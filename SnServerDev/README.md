# SnServerDev

Deprecated - Use [ServiceNowServerDev](https://github.com/erwinel/ServiceNowServerDev) repository, instead.

The initial purpose of this project is to provide customizable intellisense in TypeScript source files for building ServiceNow server scripts, allowing them to be compiled as JavaScript code and used in ServiceNow.

The long-term goal is to create an emulation platform to allow some testing and debugging capability.
